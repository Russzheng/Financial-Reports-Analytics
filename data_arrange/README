This folder will most likely be useless for you.

But if you are reading this. Here are some READMES.

It contains the index csv files that list out every file we have.

report_num, contributor, ticker are used to name and sort files.

stocking rating and other columns will be used as labels in supervised training.

so for search_sort.py
to run it: cd to the directory, python3 search_sort.py
This is the program used to find all pdf/xml files in the hard disk and put them in a subfolder.
like: blah blah blah/<contributor>/<ticker>/<filename>

Attention:
I first create directories according to the index csv file. Since we have over a million files.
Divide and conquer tat!

Then I will search, move and sort the files!
