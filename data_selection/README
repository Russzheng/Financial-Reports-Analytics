This is the stencil folder containing codes for data collection.

data is the folder for storing the collected data.

file_number is the folder to store files containing information about 1. ids of files we need to collect
2. ids of corrupted files 3. ids of files that failed to download/convert and etc.

output is the folder containing output csv files, listing files that were 1. successfully added 2. non-existent (need further redownloading and etc.)

Check success.csv and failure.csv to check which files were successfully added to the folder and which were not.

pre_process.py is the python file to get the list of ids of files that we need and are not corrupted or non-existent, and it will store files in data folder.

Change directories if you want!

It might take a while. Be patient.

test.py is the file we use to double check the IDs of the files wefull_initiation report id.csv successfully/unsuccessfully collected.

Check the two output files in the output folder with prefix 'doublecheck' for details.

sort_file.py is the file we use to sort files into different folders by contributors. full_initiation report id.csv contains all information about initiation reports. One thing we are particularly interested is the contributors' name as we try to clean the data by contributors.
