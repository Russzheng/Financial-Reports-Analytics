To run the program
python3 LDA.py

data folder should contain all the text files you want to feed to the LDA model

data_small is the folder I used to store smaller datasets, for testing purpose mainly.

output is where I store the terminal output, for plotting, sometimes I just forgot to uncomment the plotting 
sectionin the code.

plot.py is the program I use to plot graphs perplexity--# of topics.


ATTENTION:
For LDA.py I used two models, gensim and sklearn-lda.
The lda module in sklearn is buggy, it outputs wrong perplexity score cause 
it messed probability with likelihood. So I have to use gensim for perplexity score.
However, gensim is slow af. So you can use sklearn to output topics. 
Please check comments for details of which part is gensim and which part is sklearn.
