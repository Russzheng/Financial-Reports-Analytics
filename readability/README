This folder contains the code and output of readability calculating.

It runs throught every xml file, over 1 mil.

Modify directories if data directories are different.

It uses readability calculator library (this library dont have any documentations, check the source code for details, i have stored the source codes in this folder too. the source codes are self-explanatory. Take special note on the get_all_metric or functions like this, they print out A LOT scores, counts and etc, which is REALLY useful)

Also, we used Mcdonald dictionary to count some specific words like 'negative' words.

To run the program, simply: python3 stat.py.

NOTE: if you need to change the number of columns, especially if you need to add columns, pay special attention to the length of the list of columns.
